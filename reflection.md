Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
For `House` class, I chose to overload the constructor to make `House` objects that has no dining room by default (Haven, Jordan) and `moveIn()` method to move in multiple people at once.
For `Library` class, I chose to overload the constructor to make a `Library` object with no elevator by default and `printCollection()` method to print out a list of available books only. 
For `Cafe` class, I chose to overload `sellCoffee()` and `restock()` to accommodate different coffee orders. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I could not get goToFloor() to work for `House` and `Library` when given a `floorNum ` out of range.
